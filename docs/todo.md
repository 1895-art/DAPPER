Todo
================================================
* Re-test LETKF mp on more cores

* Deal with window focus.
* Rename partial_direct_Obs -> partial_Id_Obs
* Rename dfdx -> dstep_dx
* Rename TLM -> d2x_dtdx
* Rename jacob -> linearization

* Is this why ctrl-c fails so often (from https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/select.html ):
    "Changed in version 3.5: The function is now retried with a recomputed timeout when interrupted by a signal,
    except if the signal handler raises an exception (see PEP 475 for the rationale),
    instead of raising InterruptedError."
* Avoid tqdm multiline (https://stackoverflow.com/a/38345993/38281) ???
  No, INSTEAD: capture key press and don't send to stdout

* Bugs:
    * __name__ for HMM via inspect fails when running a 2nd, â‰  script.

* Darcy, LotkaVolterra, 2pendulum, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky , Nikolaevskiy Equation
* Simplify time management?
* Use pandas for stats time series?


## DAC changes:
Try making something like the following
to deal with:
  * Use inspect somehow instead of C.update_setting
  * EITHER: Rm *args, **kwargs from da_methods? (less spelling errors)
  *         Replace with opts argument (could be anything).
  *     OR: implement warning if config argument was not used
                        (warns against misspelling, etc)

  * Use AlignedDict for DA_Config's repr?
  * Make function DA_Config() a member called 'method' of DAC. Rename DAC to DA_Config.
      => Yields (???) decorator syntax @DA_Config.method  (which would look nice) 
  * Rename DA_Config to DA_method or something
  * pass name from DAC_list to tqdm in assimilator?
  * Get rid of Tuple assignment of twin/setup items

class DA_Header:
   __init__(self,*args, **kwargs):
       write args to self

@wraps(EnKF)
EnKF_config(*args, **kwargs):
    super().__init__()
    assimilator = EnKF(*args,**kwargs)
   
def EnKF(stats,upd_a, N, infl):
    assimilate and assess
    return stats
