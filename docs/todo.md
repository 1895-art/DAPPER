Todo
================================================

Minor:

* Badges
* Improve docs
* Publish version

Major:

* Do some todos
* Make autoscaler.py work also for other users
  (I dont know if it's condor_* that outputs user-specific numbers,
  or glcoud resize command that is user-specific, or what.)
* Pause after Enter doesn't work on Ubuntu?

* Make superclasses for the filter, smoother, and iterative smoother.
* Simplify and/or generalize time management?

  * k,kObs only, yielded by ticker
  * Change KObs to KObs-1
  * Note (somewhere) the implicit dependence on t=0 being special

* Simplify and/or improve cov matrix stuff.
